Tic Tac Toe Game
Tic Tac Toe Game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking X's and O's.
- The first player to get three in a row wins the game.
- The game board can be styled using CSS to look like a Tic Tac Toe board.
- JavaScript can be used to handle the game logic, such as detecting when a cell is clicked and updating the game state accordingly.
- The game can be reset using the reset button.
- If the game ends in a draw, a message is displayed to the user.
- If a player wins, a message is displayed to the user congratulating the winner.

I hope this helps you understand this project!
